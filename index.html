          <h2>About me</h2>
          <p>
            I am a Product Owner with 4 years of experience spanning across a
            wide range of sectors ranging from B2C insurtech and PCW retail
            products. For the past 2 years, I’ve been driving innovation in an
            early-stage B2B SaaS startup within the hospitality sector, blending
            business strategy, user-centric design, and team collaboration to
            achieve results.

              <p>
                As a Product Owner at Openr, I delivered the product vision,
                shaped strategy, and prioritized backlogs to maximize value and
                business impact. I led cross-functional teams through release
                planning, testing, and market research while leveraging user
                feedback to drive improvements. Using AWS tools like CloudWatch
                for API error monitoring and S3 for payload debugging, I
                resolved issues and built a customer knowledge base to enhance
                functionality and user satisfaction.
